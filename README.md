## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- When and where do we use a link or a button? 
- Use buttons when the user- action causes a change in either back-end or the front-end of the website. For example, submitting a form, opening a pop-up or a modal or a pannel on the same page. 
- Use links when the user-action doesn't affect the website at all.

### Useful resources

- [CSS @font-face Rule](https://www.w3schools.com/CSSREF/css3_pr_font-face_rule.php) - To use fonts from within a folder
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
